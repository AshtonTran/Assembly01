# assembly
Create three variables A_register , B_register and C_register. Initialize these variables depending on the first letter of your last name:

A-G  Aregister = 0x10, Bregister = 0x20, Cregister = 0
H-P Aregister = 0x01, Bregister = 0x30, Cregister = 0
Q-Z  Aregister = 0x22, Bregister = 0x23, Cregister = 0

1.	Write a Microchip assembly language program that adds the Aregister to the Bregister and puts the sum into the Cregister.
2.	Print out add.asm file.
3.	Demonstrate the sum of the two registers to the instructor.
